## Development Build

React Test Shop makes API calls to an external server. First set up this server
by cloning the
[React Test Shop Server](https://github.com/nareshbhatia/react-test-shop-server)
repository and following the instructions there to start the API server on
port 8080.

Now run this project from another shell:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Production Build

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```
